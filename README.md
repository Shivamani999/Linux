# KERNAL & SHELL
- The computer programs that allocate the systems resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the operating system or 'KERNAL'. Users communicate with the OS through a program called the 'SHELL'.

The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution. A good shell script will have comments(#).


# LINUX LIMITATIONS
